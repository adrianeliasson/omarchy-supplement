Booting omarchy from scratch

1. Put USB stick with latest omarchy version ISO
2. Boot from USB stick and follow installation instructions
3. After completed installation I like to run Update > Omarchy and maybe Update > Firmware. Quick reboot.
4. Optional: Install brave to not leak anything to google
5. Log in to bitwarden for passwords
6. Attach an SSH key for github&git activities
7. Clone the Omarchy fresh install repository and press play ./run the install-full.sh (git@github.com:adrianeliasson/omarchy-supplement.git)
8 profit??
