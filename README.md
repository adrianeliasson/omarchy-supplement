# TODOS:
- The install-dotfiles script really should be handled by the dotfiles repository. In here I could make sure to clone the dotfiles repo and simple run the "task" command or similar, and let the dotfiles repository run the necessary checks, and stow commands
- Install thermald script (Needed for current laptop to run on Arch properly)
