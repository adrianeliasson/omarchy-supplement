# TODOS:
~~- The install-dotfiles script really should be handled by the dotfiles repository. In here I could make sure to clone the dotfiles repo and simple run the "task" command or similar, and let the dotfiles repository run the necessary checks, and stow commands~~
~~- Install thermald script (Needed for current laptop to run on Arch properly) ~~
- Install overrides for omarchy/hyprland styling: https://github.com/typecraft-dev/omarchy-supplement
- Create a curl quickstart install script (maybe. Maybe it is not suitable for programs like this but would be cool with a single line install script)
